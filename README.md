## Setting up your own INTERLINKED application

In case you want to run a bot of your own for a game of your choice, you can!

Make sure to download the [latest bot release](https://github.com/GleammerRay/INTERLINKED/releases) before proceeding.

### 1. Creating a link
1. Go to [Discord Developer Portal - My Applications](https://discord.com/developers/applications) and create a new application. [A tutorial can be found here](https://github.com/discord-apps/bot-tutorial).
2. Go to URL Generator under OAuth2 and select bot scope with permissions to send messages and to manage roles.
3. Use the generated URL to invite the bot. ü§ñ

### 2. Setting up the config

1. Make a copy of `.config.json` named `config.json` (removing the dot in the beginning).
2. Specify the `steamAppID` and `gameName` of your game in the `config.json`. Default values are for NEOTOKYO¬∞.
3. Specify your Discord bot token in `discordBotToken` in the `config.json`. You can get it from the bot section of your Discord application.
4. Specify your [Steam API key](https://steamcommunity.com/dev/apikey) in `steamAPIKey` in `config.json`.
5. If you wish to use different images, add the links of desired images to `activeImageURLs`, `fridayImageURLs` (will only show on fridays, if none are specified then images from `activeImageURLs` are used) and `mapImageURLs` (add entries in format `"<map name>": "<image url>"` (without angle brackets)).
6. You are ready to run your bot! ü¶∏


### 3. Running the bot with NodeJS

1. Get [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) (and npm if you're on linux).
2. Run `npm install` in the root of bot directory to install dependencies.
3. Run `nodejs start_bot.json` to run the bot. üèÉ

### 4. Making backups

All bot generated preferences including per-server preferences are saved in `usrprefs.json`. Make sure to back up this file regularly to avoid data loss. 

### 5. Updating

1. [Download and extract the latest available release](https://github.com/GleammerRay/INTERLINKED/releases).
2. Copy your `config.json` and `usrprefs.json` from old installation to the newly acquired release.
3. Enjoy the newest features! ‚ö°
